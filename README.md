# Simple PHP Version Management: phpenv

This is basically [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) after a mass find
and replace operation, it makes using rbenv to manage PHP versions more natural.

Use [php-build](https://github.com/CHH/php-build) and the plugin it provides to
easily build new PHP versions.

I am aware of at least one other fork of rbenv for PHP but it is butchered with
no Git history and the copyright altered so I decided against using it.
